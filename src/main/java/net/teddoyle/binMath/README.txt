    This Java program is application that uses presents a diagram
showing how gates and full adders are arranged to add or subtract
two integers inside of an ALU within the CPU.  It allows for both
signed and unsigned arithmetic, showing the results in binary,
decimal, and octal.

    The program was written for an undergraduate class in computer
architecture.  I wrote the program while I was an employee of Clemson
University in Clemson, SC, USA.

    I wrote all of the classes, except for GraphPaperLayout, which
was written by Michael Martak.

TODO: when one enters a number for A or B and tabs to another field
the number is lost.  Need to modify the code capture the numbers.
